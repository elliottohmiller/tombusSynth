This was a personal project that was meant to be a Christmas present for a friend of mine. Unfortunately, this project is still in progress a few years later, but, cest la vie! 
A working prototype was hand-wired and tested in December of 2022. Schematics are finished - I just need to finish the PCB layout and order boards / components. 

The general idea is a pedal format noise-maker that is powered with a standard center-negative 9V supply. The controls are as follows: 

POTS
"Tune" - sets the frequency of the oscillator
"LFO" - sets the frequency of the LFO
"MOD" - sets the depth of the modulation CV
"PWM" - sets the width of the oscillator 
"BLEND" - blend control to variably select square and saw-tooth oscillator waveforms
"VOLUME" - master output volume

3 POS SWITCH
"E/N," "L/N," "E/L" - Selects the modulation source. Choices are: 
External - External input that accepts 12V standard eurorack style CV
Noise - On-board transistor reverse breakdown avalanche noise source
LFO - On-board LFO

Additionally, there is an LED indicator that blinks / brightens according to the modulation signal. 

See schematic for full circuit diagrams. See PCB render for component placement and split control / signal board layout.
